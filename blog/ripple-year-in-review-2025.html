            <h1>Ripple: This Year in Review</h1>
        </header>

        <p><strong>XRPL Canada – January 3, 2026</strong></p>

        <p>Ripple Labs transformed from a specialized cross-border payments company into a comprehensive digital asset financial services powerhouse in 2025, executing one of the most ambitious strategic expansions in fintech history. Through approximately $2.7 billion in acquisitions, landmark regulatory victories, successful capital raises at a $40 billion valuation, and the launch of institutional-grade products, Ripple fundamentally repositioned itself at the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets. This review examines the company's strategic evolution, operational achievements, and market positioning throughout a year that will likely be remembered as transformative for both Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry.</p>

        <h2>Regulatory Resolution: Ending the SEC Litigation</h2>

        <p>The resolution of Ripple's legal conflict with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission represented the removal of the most significant overhang that had constrained the company's operations and market valuation since December 2020. On March 25, 2025, Ripple announced a settlement agreement with the SEC, agreeing to pay a substantially reduced fine of $50 million, down 60% from the originally imposed penalty of $125 million. This reduction reflected a significant negotiating victory for Ripple and validated the company's litigation strategy.</p>

        <p>More importantly, CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the SEC had officially dropped its appeal of the 2023 ruling by Judge Analisa Torres, which had found that XRP sales on public exchanges were not securities transactions. This judicial determination created critical precedent distinguishing between institutional sales conducted as investment contracts and programmatic sales through digital asset exchanges, establishing a framework that extended beyond Ripple to influence regulatory interpretation across the cryptocurrency sector.</p>

        <p>The settlement essentially confirmed that XRP itself is not a security when sold through public exchanges, though institutional sales conducted as investment contracts could be treated as securities offerings. This nuanced distinction provided clarity that the industry had sought for years and established a potential blueprint for how other digital assets might be analyzed under securities law.</p>

        <p>In August 2025, the legal saga officially concluded when both parties formally dropped all appeals, with Ripple making its final payment and closing the case after nearly five years of litigation. The SEC's leadership change, with Gary Gensler's departure in January 2025 following President Trump's inauguration and the subsequent appointment of Mark Uyeda as acting SEC Chair, contributed to the regulatory environment that facilitated settlement. Uyeda's appointment triggered an immediate 5% surge in XRP's price as markets anticipated a more balanced regulatory approach to digital assets.</p>

        <p>The conclusion of this litigation freed Ripple to pursue strategic initiatives that had been complicated or constrained by regulatory uncertainty. The settlement's relatively modest financial cost—$50 million represented a small fraction of Ripple's available capital—and the favorable legal interpretation it enshrined positioned the company advantageously for expansion.</p>

        <h2>Strategic Acquisitions: Building an Integrated Platform</h2>

        <p>Ripple executed an aggressive acquisition strategy in 2025, deploying approximately $2.7 billion across four major transactions designed to vertically integrate financial services capabilities. These acquisitions transformed Ripple from a company primarily focused on cross-border payments into a diversified financial infrastructure provider serving institutional clients across custody, clearing, treasury management, and wallet services.</p>

        <p>On April 8, 2025, Ripple announced the acquisition of Hidden Road, a premier institutional-grade prime brokerage firm, for $1.25 billion. Hidden Road had established itself as a leading provider of prime brokerage services to sophisticated hedge funds and trading firms, offering execution, clearing, and custody services that met institutional standards. The acquisition provided Ripple with immediate credibility and operational capability in serving the most demanding institutional clients, complementing its existing payments business with capital markets infrastructure.</p>

        <p>Hidden Road was subsequently rebranded as Ripple Prime in October 2025, marking full integration into Ripple's product suite. Ripple Prime began offering comprehensive prime brokerage services including multi-asset execution, financing, custody, and risk management to institutional clients. This capability positioned Ripple to serve as a single provider for institutions seeking integrated digital asset and traditional asset services.</p>

        <p>In October 2025, Ripple announced the acquisition of GTreasury, a treasury management systems provider, for $1 billion. GTreasury had served Fortune 500 companies for over 40 years, providing mission-critical treasury management software to some of the world's largest corporations. The acquisition represented Ripple's strategic entry into enterprise treasury management, allowing the company to offer comprehensive financial infrastructure combining payments, foreign exchange, cash management, and liquidity optimization to corporate clients.</p>

        <p>The GTreasury acquisition was particularly strategic because it provided Ripple with established relationships with large corporate treasury departments—precisely the decision-makers who would evaluate enterprise blockchain adoption. By embedding itself in the treasury management technology stack, Ripple positioned its digital asset capabilities as natural extensions of existing financial workflows rather than disruptive alternatives requiring complete operational restructuring.</p>

        <p>Ripple also acquired Rail, a stablecoin payments platform processing over 10% of the $36 billion global business-to-business stablecoin payment volume, for $200 million in August 2025. This acquisition accelerated Ripple's stablecoin strategy by providing immediate market share and operational infrastructure in the rapidly growing stablecoin payment sector. Rail's technology and customer relationships complemented RLUSD, Ripple's proprietary stablecoin.</p>

        <p>Finally, Ripple acquired Palisade, a wallet-as-a-service provider, for an undisclosed amount in October 2025. This acquisition added consumer and business wallet infrastructure to Ripple's technology portfolio, enabling the company to offer end-to-end solutions from custody through transaction execution to end-user interfaces.</p>

        <p>Combined with Ripple's 2023 acquisition of Metaco, a custody technology provider, and its 2024 acquisition of Standard Custody, these transactions brought Ripple's total acquisition spending for 2023-2025 to approximately $4 billion. This investment built a vertically integrated stack spanning custody, clearing, execution, treasury management, payments, and wallet services—infrastructure components that typically require partnerships across multiple providers.</p>

        <h2>RLUSD: Enterprise Stablecoin Infrastructure</h2>

        <p>Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin, which launched in December 2024, experienced substantial growth throughout 2025, evolving from an experimental product into a significant component of the company's strategy. RLUSD was designed as an enterprise-grade stablecoin fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. government bonds, and cash equivalents, with reserves held by BNY Mellon and verified through monthly attestations by Deloitte.</p>

        <p>The stablecoin reached $500 million in market capitalization by July 2025, crossed $1 billion in November 2025, and concluded the year at approximately $1.3 billion, making it the 11th largest stablecoin globally. This growth trajectory, while modest compared to dominant stablecoins like USDT and USDC, represented significant traction in the enterprise and institutional segments where RLUSD was positioned.</p>

        <p>RLUSD operated under a New York Department of Financial Services limited purpose trust company charter, providing regulatory clarity and compliance with state banking regulations. The July 2025 passage of the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) created the first comprehensive federal framework for payment stablecoins in the United States, providing additional regulatory certainty for RLUSD's operations and establishing clear rules for reserve requirements, redemption processes, and issuer obligations.</p>

        <p>In April 2025, Ripple integrated RLUSD into its Ripple Payments cross-border solution for select customers, combining its payment rails with its proprietary stablecoin infrastructure. This integration allowed customers to benefit from stablecoin settlement efficiency while utilizing Ripple's established network of banking partners and payout locations.</p>

        <p>Strategic partnerships expanded RLUSD's reach and use cases throughout the year. In April 2025, Ripple announced a partnership with OpenPayd to build stablecoin and payments infrastructure for businesses globally, with additional details emerging in July 2025. In September 2025, RLUSD was added to Securitize's tokenization platform, which is backed by BlackRock, allowing institutional investors to use RLUSD within tokenized securities transactions.</p>

        <p>A collaboration announced in September 2025 between DBS Bank, Franklin Templeton, and Ripple enabled trading of tokenized money market funds using RLUSD, expanding into institutional asset management applications. In November 2025, Ripple announced a partnership with Mastercard, Gemini, and WebBank to integrate RLUSD into credit card transactions, marking the first instance of a U.S. bank settling credit card transactions using stablecoins on a public blockchain.</p>

        <p>International expansion accelerated throughout the year. In September 2025, Ripple announced partnerships with Chipper Cash, VALR, and Yellow Card to launch RLUSD across multiple African markets, targeting remittance corridors and mobile money users. In November 2025, RLUSD received regulatory approval for use in Abu Dhabi Global Market, allowing FSRA-licensed firms to utilize RLUSD for regulated financial activities.</p>

        <p>In December 2025, Ripple launched RLUSD on its first Layer 2 networks, beginning testing on Optimism, Base, Ink, and Unichain through a partnership with Wormhole, a cross-chain messaging protocol. This multichain expansion increased RLUSD's accessibility and reduced transaction costs for users operating across multiple blockchain networks.</p>

        <p>The stablecoin's growth validated Ripple's strategy of building regulated, institutional-grade infrastructure that could serve as a bridge between traditional financial systems and digital asset capabilities. RLUSD's integration across payments, credit cards, tokenized securities, and decentralized finance positioned it as versatile infrastructure rather than a single-purpose payment token.</p>

        <h2>Banking Charter: Entering Regulated Banking</h2>

        <p>In what may prove to be Ripple's most strategically significant regulatory achievement, the company received conditional approval for a National Trust Bank Charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in December 2025. Ripple had formally applied for this charter in July 2025, signaling its ambition to operate as a federally chartered financial institution.</p>

        <p>The charter approval, which established Ripple National Trust Bank, conferred several critical capabilities. As a federally chartered bank, Ripple gained the ability to conduct banking operations across all 50 states without obtaining individual state licenses, dramatically simplifying regulatory compliance and operational expansion. The charter provided direct access to Federal Reserve payment infrastructure including FedWire and FedNow, enabling Ripple to settle transactions through the same systems used by traditional banks.</p>

        <p>Most importantly, the charter positioned Ripple to offer traditional banking services—custody, payments, clearing—alongside digital asset services within a single regulatory framework. This integration eliminated the structural separation that typically existed between traditional banking and cryptocurrency operations, allowing Ripple to provide seamless services spanning both domains.</p>

        <p>The charter also enhanced RLUSD's regulatory positioning. With a national trust bank managing RLUSD reserves, the stablecoin business became subject to oversight at both state and federal levels through the New York Department of Financial Services and the OCC, providing additional regulatory assurance to institutional users.</p>

        <p>Ripple became one of the first major cryptocurrency companies to receive federal bank charter approval, setting precedent for the industry. The approval suggested that the OCC, under new leadership aligned with the Trump administration's more favorable stance toward digital assets, viewed properly structured and adequately capitalized cryptocurrency firms as capable of meeting traditional banking standards.</p>

        <h2>Capital Markets and Fundraising</h2>

        <p>In November 2025, Ripple announced it had raised $500 million at a $40 billion valuation from a consortium of premier institutional investors including Citadel Securities, Fortress Investment Group, Marshall Wace, Brevan Howard, Pantera Capital, and Galaxy Digital. This fundraise occurred during Ripple's annual Swell conference in New York City and represented a landmark moment for the company and the broader cryptocurrency industry.</p>

        <p>The $40 billion valuation positioned Ripple as one of the most valuable private fintech companies globally, exceeding the valuations of most traditional payment processors and rivaling major financial services firms. The investor consortium represented a mix of traditional finance (Citadel Securities, Fortress, Marshall Wace, Brevan Howard) and digital asset specialists (Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital), demonstrating crossover appeal and validation from both sectors.</p>

        <p>The capital raise provided Ripple with substantial resources to fund continued acquisitions, product development, geographic expansion, and operational scaling. Having deployed approximately $2.7 billion in acquisitions during 2025, the $500 million infusion replenished capital reserves and maintained financial flexibility for future strategic opportunities.</p>

        <p>Notably, Ripple confirmed in April 2025 that it had no plans for an initial public offering in 2025, with CEO Brad Garlinghouse indicating the company was focused on organic growth and strategic acquisitions rather than accessing public markets. The ability to raise substantial private capital at a premium valuation reduced the immediate pressure to pursue an IPO, allowing Ripple to remain private while executing its transformation strategy without public market scrutiny.</p>

        <h2>XRP ETF Ecosystem Development</h2>

        <p>The launch of spot XRP exchange-traded funds in the United States represented a significant milestone in XRP's evolution into a mainstream investment asset and validated institutional demand for regulated exposure to the token. On November 13, 2025, Canary Capital launched the first spot XRP ETF, attracting over $250 million in inflows on its first trading day.</p>

        <p>This initial launch was rapidly followed by offerings from major asset managers including Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, Grayscale, and 21Shares, creating a comprehensive suite of XRP investment products. By early December 2025, spot XRP ETFs collectively surpassed $1 billion in total assets under management, making XRP the fastest cryptocurrency to reach this milestone since Ethereum ETFs launched. By year-end, cumulative net inflows into XRP ETFs reached approximately $1.25 billion.</p>

        <p>The ETF launches provided traditional investors with regulated, familiar investment vehicles for gaining XRP exposure without directly purchasing and custody tokens. The products traded on established stock exchanges through standard brokerage accounts, eliminating technical barriers that had historically limited retail and institutional participation in cryptocurrency markets.</p>

        <p>The rapid asset accumulation demonstrated sustained institutional and retail demand even during holiday trading periods and market volatility. The diversity of providers created competitive pressure on fees, with expense ratios ranging from 0.20% to 0.75%, benefiting investors through lower costs.</p>

        <p>While Ripple did not directly manage these ETFs, their existence enhanced the legitimacy and accessibility of XRP as an asset, potentially expanding the addressable market for XRP-related services and infrastructure. The ETF ecosystem also created natural constituencies of institutional investors with economic interests aligned with XRP's success.</p>

        <h2>Payments Business Performance</h2>

        <p>Despite Ripple's transformation into a diversified financial services provider, its core cross-border payments business continued to demonstrate strong performance throughout 2025. RippleNet, the company's global payments network, achieved coverage of 90+ payout markets representing 90% of daily foreign exchange markets by year-end.</p>

        <p>Annual payment volume processed through Ripple Payments exceeded $70 billion in 2025, representing substantial transaction throughput and demonstrating the platform's operational scale. In Q2 2025, Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity service, which utilizes XRP for instant settlement, processed approximately $1.3 trillion in payment volume, showing dramatic growth in the adoption of XRP-based liquidity solutions.</p>

        <p>Ripple maintained partnerships with over 300 banks and financial institutions by year-end, including major entities such as PNC, American Express, and Santander. These relationships provided distribution for Ripple's expanding product suite and validated the company's ability to meet the compliance and operational standards required by regulated financial institutions.</p>

        <p>In March 2025, Ripple received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority to expand its regulated crypto payment services in the Dubai International Financial Centre, one of the world's leading financial hubs. In May 2025, Ripple received permission to expand its payments business operations in Singapore, another critical Asian fintech hub. These approvals demonstrated regulatory acceptance in key international markets and positioned Ripple for continued geographic expansion.</p>

        <p>Ripple also supported central bank digital currency development in more than 20 countries, providing technology and consulting services to national monetary authorities exploring digital currency issuance. This work positioned Ripple's technology as potential infrastructure for sovereign digital currencies, representing a potentially transformative long-term opportunity.</p>

        <p>In September 2025, Ripple announced an expanded partnership with Thunes, a global business-to-business payments network, to transform cross-border payments globally. This built on an initial collaboration established in 2020, significantly expanding scope and scale to address persistent inefficiencies in international money movement.</p>

        <h2>XRP Market Performance</h2>

        <p>XRP's price performance in 2025 reflected the dramatic developments in Ripple's business and the broader cryptocurrency market's volatility. The token began the year around $2.07-$2.32 and reached an all-time high of $3.65 in July 2025, surpassing its previous peak from January 2018. At this level, XRP's market capitalization exceeded $200 billion, making it one of the top three cryptocurrencies by market cap.</p>

        <p>However, the token experienced substantial volatility throughout the year. After the January settlement announcement, XRP declined to a local bottom of $1.60 in April 2025, representing more than a 50% decline from the January peak of $3.40. This correction was attributed to profit-taking following the SEC settlement and broader cryptocurrency market weakness, including impacts from tariff announcements.</p>

        <p>XRP rallied approximately 40% during April as bullish sentiment returned, traded around $3.10 in February with approximately 45% monthly gains, and surged following positive regulatory developments and ETF anticipation. By late December 2025, XRP traded around $1.84-$1.90, down approximately 48% from the July all-time high but down only 11-13% year-to-date from the start of 2025.</p>

        <p>Despite ending the year with modest losses, XRP significantly outperformed Bitcoin (down 18%) and Ethereum (down 27%) for 2025, demonstrating relative strength amid challenging market conditions. Monthly XRP escrow unlocks continued throughout the year, with Ripple releasing 1 billion XRP from programmatic escrow accounts each month as part of the schedule established in 2017.</p>

        <h2>Strategic Positioning and Future Outlook</h2>

        <p>Ripple concluded 2025 having fundamentally repositioned itself as a comprehensive digital asset financial services provider. The company's product ecosystem now spanned cross-border payments through RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity, enterprise stablecoin infrastructure through RLUSD, institutional prime brokerage through Ripple Prime, custody solutions through acquired entities, treasury management for Fortune 500 companies through GTreasury, wallet infrastructure through Palisade, and pending full-service banking capabilities through Ripple National Trust Bank.</p>

        <p>This vertical integration created a rare capability set in both traditional finance and digital assets. Few companies could offer custody, clearing, execution, payments, treasury management, stablecoin issuance, and wallet services within integrated infrastructure. Even fewer could operate across both traditional banking and digital asset domains with appropriate regulatory authorization.</p>

        <p>The company's $40 billion valuation, substantial capital resources, regulatory victories, and strategic acquisitions positioned Ripple advantageously as institutional adoption of digital assets accelerated. The transformation from payments specialist to integrated financial infrastructure provider reflected management's recognition that the future competitive landscape would reward companies capable of seamlessly bridging traditional and digital finance rather than operating exclusively in one domain.</p>

        <p>The challenges ahead remain substantial. Ripple must successfully integrate approximately $2.7 billion in acquisitions, each with distinct cultures, technologies, and customer bases. The company must execute its banking charter obligations while maintaining the operational flexibility that characterized its previous structure. RLUSD must achieve substantially greater scale to compete with established stablecoins backed by far larger issuers.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, Ripple's 2025 performance demonstrated execution capability across legal, regulatory, strategic, and operational dimensions. The company navigated complex litigation to a favorable resolution, executed multiple large acquisitions, launched new products that achieved meaningful scale, secured landmark regulatory approvals, and raised substantial capital at a premium valuation. This track record suggested that Ripple entered 2026 well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities its transformation strategy had created.</p>
