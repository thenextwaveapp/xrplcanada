            <h1>XRP Ledger: This Year in Review</h1>
        </header>

        <p><strong>XRPL Canada – December 29, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>The XRP Ledger concluded 2025 as one of the most technologically advanced and actively developed blockchain networks in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Throughout the year, the protocol underwent significant upgrades driven by its decentralized community of validators and developers, while simultaneously expanding its real-world applications across payments, decentralized finance, tokenization, and enterprise infrastructure. This comprehensive review examines the technical evolution, ecosystem growth, and strategic positioning that defined the XRP Ledger's trajectory in 2025.</p>

        <h2>Technical Evolution and Protocol Upgrades</h2>

        <p>The XRP Ledger demonstrated robust technical advancement throughout 2025, with multiple protocol amendments successfully proposed, voted upon, and activated by the network's decentralized validator community. This governance model, which requires 80% consensus among validators for amendment activation, ensured that upgrades were thoroughly vetted and broadly supported before implementation.</p>

        <p>In May 2025, two critical amendments became enabled on the mainnet. The fixFrozenLPTokenTransfer amendment introduced enhanced clawback functionality specifically designed for Automated Market Maker pools, addressing edge cases in liquidity provision and token management. Concurrently, the fixInvalidTxFlags amendment strengthened transaction validation protocols, improving the overall security posture of the ledger.</p>

        <p>June marked a pivotal moment with the activation of the DynamicNFT amendment on June 11, 2025. This upgrade introduced mutable Non-Fungible Tokens to the XRP Ledger, allowing NFTs minted with the tfMutable flag to have their URI fields updated after initial creation. The significance of this amendment extended beyond its technical specifications; it was developed and activated entirely by independent community contributors, demonstrating the XRP Ledger's genuinely decentralized governance structure. This capability opened new possibilities for evolving digital assets, dynamic metadata, and use cases requiring post-mint flexibility.</p>

        <p>The protocol's evolution continued with Version 2.5.0, which introduced the Batch amendment through the XLS-56 specification. This transformative upgrade enabled atomic transaction capabilities, allowing users to group up to eight transactions into a single batch processed simultaneously. The amendment supported four execution modes: ALLORNOTHING, which requires all transactions to succeed or all fail; ONLYONE, which executes only the first successful transaction; UNTILFAILURE, which processes transactions sequentially until one fails; and INDEPENDENT, which attempts all transactions regardless of individual outcomes. Industry observers, including Robert Kiuru, COO at XRPL Labs, characterized Batch transactions as one of the most important amendments to the ecosystem, enabling greater transparency in monetization strategies and facilitating fully peer-to-peer NFT-to-NFT trading platforms where users could execute barter-like swaps in single atomic operations.</p>

        <p>Version 2.5.0 also included the fixAMMv1_3 amendment, which resolved rounding issues in AMM deposits and implemented stricter validation mechanisms in auction slot procedures. Additionally, the fixEnforceNFTokenTrustlineV2 amendment addressed vulnerabilities that could have allowed NFT issuers to inappropriately receive fungible tokens as transfer fees.</p>

        <p>By December 2025, Version 3.0.0 entered development with five amendments in various stages of readiness. The fixPriceOracleOrder amendment resolved discrepancies in asset pair data ordering between oracle creation and updates, ensuring canonical consistency. The fixTokenEscrowV1 amendment corrected accounting errors discovered in Multi-Purpose Token escrows, addressing bugs in the original implementation. Additional amendments including fixAMMClawbackRounding, fixIncludeKeyletFields, and fixMPTDeliveredAmount further refined the protocol's functionality.</p>

        <p>Looking forward to 2026, the XRP Ledger community prepared for its most ambitious upgrade yet: a native lending protocol specified in XLS-65 and XLS-66. This system would enable on-chain, fixed-term, uncollateralized loans using pooled funds from Single Asset Vaults, introducing pooled lending and underwritten credit directly at the ledger level. The relevant amendments were scheduled to enter validator voting in late January 2026, with privacy features including zero-knowledge proofs for confidential Multi-Purpose Tokens planned for Q1 2026.</p>

        <h2>The EVM Sidechain: Bridging Ecosystems</h2>

        <p>Perhaps the most strategically significant technical development of 2025 was the mainnet launch of the XRPL EVM Sidechain on June 30, 2025. This infrastructure brought full Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility to the XRP Ledger ecosystem while maintaining a direct connection to the mainnet, effectively bridging the substantial developer communities and tooling ecosystems of both networks.</p>

        <p>The EVM-compatible sidechain operated with wrapped XRP (wXRP) as its native gas token, targeting performance metrics exceeding 1,000 transactions per second with transaction costs maintained below $0.01. This combination of high throughput and minimal costs positioned the sidechain as an attractive platform for developers seeking to deploy Ethereum-compatible smart contracts without the cost constraints typically associated with Ethereum mainnet deployment.</p>

        <p>Market response validated the infrastructure's appeal. Within its first week of operation, the XRPL EVM Sidechain attracted over 1,400 smart contracts, demonstrating immediate developer adoption. This rapid uptake suggested that the technical execution met market demands for accessible, cost-effective smart contract deployment with the security and reliability associated with the broader XRP Ledger ecosystem.</p>

        <p>The sidechain architecture preserved the core characteristics that distinguished the XRP Ledger—speed, cost-efficiency, and environmental sustainability—while expanding the range of applications that could be built within the ecosystem. Developers gained access to the extensive library of Ethereum development tools, frameworks, and documentation while benefiting from the XRP Ledger's infrastructure and community.</p>

        <h2>Network Growth and Transaction Volume</h2>

        <p>The XRP Ledger experienced substantial growth across multiple metrics throughout 2025, reflecting increased adoption and utility. Data from July 2025 revealed that the network had processed over 70 million transactions, with more than 1 million new accounts created year-to-date. This account growth may have been significantly influenced by the December 2024 reduction in account reserve requirements from 10 XRP to 1 XRP, which lowered the barrier to entry for new users by reducing onboarding costs by 90%.</p>

        <p>Cross-chain interoperability expanded significantly, with $165 million in assets transferred via Axelar, a leading cross-chain messaging protocol. This figure demonstrated the XRP Ledger's increasing integration with the broader blockchain ecosystem and its role as a hub for multi-chain asset movement.</p>

        <p>The network's infrastructure supported an expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications, payment solutions, and institutional integrations. Throughout 2025, the XRP Ledger maintained its reputation for reliability and consistency, processing transactions with sub-five-second settlement times and transaction costs measured in fractions of a cent, characteristics that remained attractive to both retail users and institutional adopters.</p>

        <h2>Institutional Adoption and Real-World Applications</h2>

        <p>The XRP Ledger's institutional adoption trajectory accelerated throughout 2025, driven by partnerships that demonstrated practical applications of blockchain technology in regulated financial contexts. In July 2025, Ripple appointed the Bank of New York Mellon, one of the world's oldest and largest custody banks, as the primary custodian for Ripple's U.S. operations. This relationship provided institutional credibility and ensured that assets managed on or in connection with the XRP Ledger met the custody standards required by institutional investors and regulated financial entities.</p>

        <p>Real estate tokenization emerged as a significant use case when Ripple partnered with Dubai Land Department and Ctrl Alt in July 2025 to support property tokenization on the XRP Ledger. This initiative positioned the network as infrastructure for real-world asset digitization, a sector projected to reach multi-trillion-dollar valuations in coming years. The partnership leveraged the XRP Ledger's native token standards, transaction speed, and cost efficiency to create accessible infrastructure for property rights management and fractional ownership models.</p>

        <p>The expansion of institutional relationships continued with the alliance between Ripple and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which deepened in July 2025 after an initial partnership formed in 2016. This long-term collaboration demonstrated sustained institutional confidence in the XRP Ledger's technical capabilities and regulatory positioning.</p>

        <p>In September 2025, Mercy Corps Ventures piloted an innovative drought and rainfall insurance program in Kenya using RLUSD stablecoin to automate insurance payouts through smart contracts. Supported by a $25,000 contribution from Ripple, this initiative demonstrated how blockchain infrastructure could deliver financial services to underserved populations in emerging markets, with the XRP Ledger's speed and low costs making micropayments and automated settlements economically viable.</p>

        <h2>Developer Ecosystem and Community Events</h2>

        <p>The XRP Ledger's developer community demonstrated vitality throughout 2025 through a series of hackathons, conferences, and educational initiatives.

The event featured prominent speakers including Ripple CTO David Schwartz, former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo, FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, and crypto attorney John Deaton. Institutional representation included delegates from JPMorgan, Citi, Uphold, and Verity One, signaling mainstream financial sector interest in the XRP Ledger ecosystem.</p>

        <p>The conference format evolved to include a Shark Tank-style pitch competition with $25,000 in prize money, providing funding and exposure for emerging projects building on the XRP Ledger. This competitive element stimulated innovation and entrepreneurship within the developer community.</p>

        <p>The XRPL Apex conference in Singapore on June 10-12, 2025, attracted 800 attendees from diverse industries and featured 115 speakers addressing topics including artificial intelligence integration, decentralized finance, tokenization, stablecoins, and on-chain compliance. The event included UBRI Connect, the University Blockchain Research Initiative's flagship academic gathering, which brought together scholars and researchers to showcase blockchain research initiatives and foster academic engagement with the XRP Ledger ecosystem.</p>

        <p>In September 2025, the XRPL Hackathon Seoul concluded with over 150 participants and 30 teams presenting blockchain-fintech projects. Uniport won the Grand Prize with an automated settlement solution for foreign residents using stablecoin-based payment systems incorporating XRP and RLUSD. The subsequent XRP Seoul conference on September 21, 2025, brought approximately 3,000 participants from more than 40 countries to the COEX Auditorium in Gangnam. Key speakers included representatives from RippleX, Spartan Group, Pantera Capital, SBI Ripple Asia, Binance, Woori Bank, and Mirae Asset, addressing market outlooks, regulatory dynamics, system upgrades, and partnerships with Korean government entities.</p>

        <p>These events collectively demonstrated the global reach and diversity of the XRP Ledger community, with significant presence in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The geographic distribution of engagement reflected the network's positioning as globally relevant infrastructure rather than regionally concentrated technology.</p>

        <h2>Strategic Partnerships and Market Integration</h2>

        <p>Throughout 2025, the XRP Ledger benefited from strategic partnerships that expanded its utility and market reach. In August 2025, SBI Holdings signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Ripple and SBI VC Trade to introduce RLUSD stablecoin to the Japanese market by 2026. This partnership represented significant progress in accessing one of Asia's most sophisticated and regulated financial markets.</p>

        <p>In December 2025, SBI Ripple Asia partnered with Doppler Finance to explore XRP-based yield products and real-world asset tokenization on the XRP Ledger, with SBI Digital Markets serving as the institutional custodian. This collaboration positioned the XRP Ledger as infrastructure for structured financial products and tokenized securities, expanding beyond its historical focus on payments and remittances.</p>

        <p>The network's infrastructure supported Ripple's collaboration with over 300 financial institutions by year-end, including major entities such as PNC, American Express, and Santander. Additionally, Ripple supported central bank digital currency development in more than 20 countries, positioning the XRP Ledger technology stack as potential infrastructure for sovereign digital currencies.</p>

        <h2>Year-End Performance and Future Outlook</h2>

        <p>The XRP Ledger concluded 2025 having established itself as mature, battle-tested infrastructure with an active developer community, growing institutional adoption, and a clear technical roadmap.
